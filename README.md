### Amity Social SDK
allows engineers to integrate social communities and user feed capabilities without the hassle of deploying and maintaining any server infrastructure. Companies can now build user-powered social news feeds and notifications into their mobile and web app in no time. Enabling you to engage your customers with the same tools used by many of the popular social applications.

Let users create engaging content and engage with others through comments and reactions. Users can follow other users or topics and become members of various groups to get a personalized timeline of content. Activity feeds are also a great feature to directly engage with users.

- Connect users through formation of communities
- Boost user engagement by user-generated posts/comments in communities
- Personalize the feed based on userâ€™s membership to different groups and communities
- React to user-generated content with our reaction tools
- Enable comments on posts within your application, seamlessly
- Support multiple messaging formats when posting content
- Manage & moderate communities and users in admin panel
